## 📌 Project Overview

Potato diseases can significantly reduce crop yield if not identified early.

This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on potato leaf images to classify leaves into three categories:

- 🍃 Early Blight
- 🍂 Late Blight
- ✅ Healthy

The trained model is integrated into a Streamlit web application that allows users to upload an image and receive an instant prediction with confidence.
